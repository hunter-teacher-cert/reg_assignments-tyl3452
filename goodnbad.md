- Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly.
  - Why do you think it didn't go well?
  - What would you do (have you done) to make it better?

An instance where I it went poorly was when I was going over binary search more in-depth a few years ago than I normally would have after going over linear search with the class. Linear search is generally easier for students to understand. Now, students are keeping track of multiple variables and going through data and the indices and mistaking them which is a common misconception. Students understand the logic and with animation, but translating that into code is a huge leap. I didn't setup the students correctly. I typed into a doc during each iteration to keep track of the indices and values and the target with an animation, but I should have done it by hand. Allow more time, to let students absorb the algorithm in class, have groups discussions and planning stages, then another day or two to implement and test their algorithm.



- Describe an instance when you were teaching something computer science related and it went really well.
  - Why do you think it went so well?
  - These examples could come from normal classes, presentations, tutoring sessions, helping a friend, as long as you were teaching, it can count.

An instance where it went really well was a recent example where I had my classes code a binary to decimal converter. I took a day to do offline math conversions on handouts. Then another day for students to plan their algorithm and write in a planning document I created. Students had to write pseudocode first, (planned on flowcharts, but decided against it last minute just because of paper shortage), then plan their code such as how many varaibles do you need, write the names and purpose, what data type will it contain, what values are you expecting?). I stretched this new exercise from 2 days into 4 and I was extremely happy with the evidence of student learning which had a high percentage of working applications. I used the binary to decimal converter project to lead into the caesar cipher encryption lab which is similar but adds a layer of encryption. The results and of combining these two labs and having students complete the planning stages have been much more effective and sets the students up for more success.
