## Description
One programming task I have is to write a binary to decimal (and then hexadecimal) converter, both in Snap and one section in python.
I start offline and make it a math lesson where we go over how to do it by hand and how easily students are able to get the notion different number systems and place values. However, I ask students to incrementally complete the coding steps. They will write pseudocode based off the math lesson we did in one day. The next day is to write the pseudocode and compare it with their partner(s). The next day, students will write their code each incremental part and test it. Snap students will code the blocks and be able to test. Python students will write code but not be able to test it immediately until the next day. The last day of the programming assignment has them copying their code into repl.it and testing their code.

The Task -
- Offline math lesson on conversion between number conversion (worksheets)
- Pseudocode of formula used in previous step, compare with partner(s)
- Write code to implement the pseudocode (compare with partner(s))
- Test code with test appropriate test cases
- Write a main program implementing their converter

## Results of searches
Usually the first direct results are either math based without any code. If a language is entered with the search keywords, the first few examples are usually very high level and very excellent code examples. It usually includes a very efficient algorithm that we have not gone over in class or syntax that you never used in class.
For snap, it's hard to find that high level program. For python, you get college level answers with very efficient code. The code is useful in that it helps the student gets started. For the students who may be a little lost, they may not know what all the terms mean or why there is a variable here but not there. There was code there to be copied. Some of the websites are education focused and do try to provide explanations and pseudocode. So a lot of explanation is provided is a lot of results. However, some terms logic may still be too far above for the average sophomore. A student who reads the explanation and is already ok at analyzing code would be able ot learn from it. The downside is the student that is lost may use the code and not read the explanations or want to go through productive struggle to lock in the knowldge.
