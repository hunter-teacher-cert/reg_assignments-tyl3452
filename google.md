## Description
One programming task I have is to write a binary to decimal (and then hexadecimal) converter, both in Snap and one section in python.
I start offline and make it a math lesson where we go over how to do it by hand and how easily students are able to get the notion different number systems and place values. However, I ask students to incrementally complete the coding steps. They will write pseudocode based off the math lesson we did in one day. The next day is to write the pseudocode and compare it with their partner(s). The next day, students will write their code each incremental part and test it. Snap students will code the blocks and be able to test. Python students will write code but not be able to test it.
