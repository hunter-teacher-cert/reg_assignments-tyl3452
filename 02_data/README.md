Data Lesson Plan

Objective: Gather and investigate a dataset

Files:
- names.zip - Compressed folder of names of children from the Social Security. Insider the names zip file, there are individual files for each year.
  - i.e. yob1880 contains a list of names and the frequency of children with that name and separated by gender int he year 1880.
  - Inside the file...  Mary,F,7065...  would indicate that there are 7065 female assigned gender children named Mary born in 1880. If you search for Mary in the same file,
  - you'll find... Mary,M,27 ... which would indicate 27 male assigned gender at birth named Mary born in 1880.

- Download data
  - Download the names.zip file
  - Decompress the names.zip file

- Find data
  - Pick a year you want to search. If you have a child, search for your child's year of birth. You can also search your own year of birth or anybody else.
  - Search (you may use CTRL+F) for the name.
  - Search for the name a second time to see if the name shows up for children that were assigned another gender at birth.

- Analyze data
  - Write two statements that you can glean from the data.
  - (Optional, if there is time) Chart the data. One way is to chart the popularity of some names over time.
    - Choose a top name in a specific year, such as Mary in 1880, and gather data for Mary in all subsequent years. 
    - Can do this for just a 10 year period if you're doing it manually.
    - Otherwise, a progam to open and search for each file would be useful.
