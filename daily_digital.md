Credit card-sized device focuses terahertz energy to generate high-resolution images

The miniaturization and higher frequencies of the potential device can help make imaging faster and higher resolution. As we've seen with some existing technology, as you make it portable and easier to use and useful, the technologu will be adapted rather quickly.

Terahertz waves are super high frequency and have the health benefit of x-rays without the negative effect. The device is smaller and more precise and some applications could be used for imaging in automobiles, drones, military applications, and much more.

Are there any negative effects we are not considering?
