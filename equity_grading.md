Equity in Grading


- Do you agree/disagree with the general sentiment?

I generally agree with the advice provided in terms of wording it as mastery of a concept not points for grades. Some of the advice though is too idealistic and anytime a person mentions these strategies you wonder how long they've taught in a classroom and if they still do.


- Do you have specific points of agreemnt/disagreement?

I highly agree with the point where providing a rubric to provide what level is considered mastery. I like to think being a nerd and projecting you are passionate about a topic and what constitutes mastery and the levels leading up to it are very important. However, admins will ask for very very specific examples which makes it into a checklist and takes away from the intent. Also, some teachers will openly disparage why certain skills are important or helpful and sticks mainly to do something and get points for a grade.

I highly disagree with the point where one example of a teacher not giving points for the prep work magically changed the class. Having class norms to have students try the work is great but not realistic in practice. The example of the free throw practice is way off where yes you will have students doing the practice. But if students know that if they don't do the practice, and still be able to play in the game then you'll have a significant number of students not practicing their free throws if it has no effect on them. Why do we need coaches then? If you only put the best player, you need to show them what practices are needed to help them get better and give them a higher chance to play in the game.  It is idealistic and I prefer it this way but it's not recognizing the rollercoaster of human motivation and drive.

I believe that there should not be any late penalties given some caveats. The caveats is students learn at different speeds. However, again this is idealistic. You can plan logisitically to grade one assignment multiple times and do one off grading. Not practical. Auto-graders can help with this however, depends on how you implement the auto-grader as students will jam in whatever logic to fit the requirements and miss out on elegant and clear design. However, school is only during a given time period so if the student doesn't finish a course they should be able to finish the next semester. However, that's a hard thing to do in a semester and sequential based society.

I highly agree about that we should do "less planning". It's not less planning but less writing a script for lessons and focus on students. 


- For those of you currently teaching: Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?

I'd like to implement mastery level rubrics in every and have already up to a certain point. 
As for lateness, I would prefer to not take off points but I've done that in the past and you end up grading a project due 2 months ago multiple times. A school and classes that still work on the points for grades system will have the students trained for it so hard to change that perception in just one class.



Some thoughts?
What does he mean by it used to be targeted for white males and communicating to them what values? I'm honestly very confused.
