# Data lesson feedback

Some questions/feedback I received while planning this lesson:
- How would a student who never used a spreadsheet know where to start?
- What is the differentiation for a student who may have issues with graphing the data?
- What are you differentiating for? I believe I'm differentiating for students who don't have access to a computer and general software like MS Excel or Sheets and it is their first experience with it.



The way I decided to modify my lesson was to narrow the scope of the lesson. Originally I wanted to do more in this one day lesson and activity. However, based on the feedback, it seemed the lesson and activity assumed too much prior knowledge too soon. I broke up the lessons into three parts instead of the two I originally planned. The first part before my lessons would be introduction in spreadsheets. Given a csv file, import the data and manipulate it in a spreadsheet. Then used built in charting to create a couple line charts. This allows students to get acquainted with spreadsheet programs.
My current lesson builds from the previous lesson. I add a live demo as all student would benefit from seeing live interaction with the software and audio instructions. However, I also plan to incorporate a lab document for students who do well with written instructions and screenshots so they can move along faster at their own pace.
