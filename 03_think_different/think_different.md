I like to rotate a few different strategies.
- I like to live code / code-along with the class. I demo an example working product at the beginning of the lesson. As the lesson progresses, half-way through or every 15-20 minutes, I ask students to look at their screen so they can see and hear my explain my thought process up and code. I code up to a certain point and leave the rest for the students to complete. This gives the students an initial time period to try it out on their own. The higher students will get started and hit the ground running and may not even pay attention to the code-along or maybe just check their current code to see they are the right path. The average student will generally pay attention as they will have started but would like to see a first example. The struggling student will need the differentiation of watching a tutorial, listening to thought process, and getting the initial blocks in order so they can complete the logic problem. An issue that arises is if I do this too often, the average student will wait for the live coding.
